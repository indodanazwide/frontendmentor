# Product list with cart
*Practice updating the UI in multiple places based on user actions. The starter download also included a **JSON** file to help me practice populating the **DOM** dynamically.*

The challenge is to build a product list project that includes a functional cart

### Users should be able to:

-   Add items to the cart and remove them
-   Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
-   See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
-   Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
-   Navigate the whole project and perform all actions using only their keyboard
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Tech Stack

-   Semantic HTML5
-   CSS3 flexbox and grid layout
-   JavaScript with DOM Manipulation
-   JSON for data (using fetch API)
-   DOM for document manipulation
